# Reducing Costs with Duck Typing

# Treat objects as if they are defined by their behavior rather than by their class

# Recognizing Hidden Ducks

# - Case statements that switch on class
# - kind_of? and is_a?
# - responds_to?

# Summary

# Messages are at the center of object-oriented applications and they pass among
# objects along public interfaces. Duck typing detaches these public interfaces
# from specific classes, creating virtual types that are defined by what they do
# instead of by who they are.
# Duck typing reveals underlying abstractions that might otherwise be invisible.
# Depending on these abstractions reduces risk and increases flexibility, making
# your application cheaper to maintain and easier to change.
